# Spatial-eco-evo

Simulation code and data for the M.Sc. Thesis "Eco-evolutionary dynamics in mutualistic metacommunities: Landscape connectivity and heterogeneity delay pollinator extinction".

This repository contains the simulation and analyses code and the data presented in the thesis.

The script files "spatial_eco_evo_functions_random" and "spatial_eco_evo_functions_grid" contain the functions needed to run the simulations in the notebooks.The script "periodic_boundary" is needed to set up the grid landscapes.

The notebooks "Heatmaps simulations random geometric graphs" and "Heatmaps simulations regular grids" are purely for data generation, no analysis.
The other notebooks and the netlogo file "Networks" are for data analysis or both data generation and analysis.
